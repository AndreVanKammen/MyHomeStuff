# MyHomeStuff
The stuff i use for my simple home automation and power monitoring

-pi is a backup from some folders of the pi is use for home automation
-bridge2mqtt Contains a c++ client i wrote that move p1 and modbus data to mqqt (very messy but small and simple, works on my machine)
-licht is a backup of my website containing a small modile installable client for the lights and power monitoring (also some other projets html for the christmass tree)

It depends on mosquitto (and libs and client) and libmodbus being installed on the pi
